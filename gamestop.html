				<p>
					At five guys there were two main positons. The Red-Shirts, who were like the regular employees. Then there were the Grey-Shirts who were the managers. I was a Red-Shirt.
					My job was every job. I Prepared the food before it was ready to get cooked. For example, I'd soak the potatos to prepare them for frying or blend the strawberries so
					they couyld be added to shakes. Then, I'd help cook the food and then gather it into it's respective orders and give them to the customers while also fixing any mistakes
					that the customers bring to attention. I would also take orders and keep the dining area clean.
