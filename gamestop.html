				<p>
					I started working at <strong id="gs">Gamestop</strong> in the <strong class="gs-description">September of 2014</strong>. I chose to work at Gamestop because I enjoy video games
					and getting paid to sell them sounded awesome. While I worked there, I operated the cash register to literally sell the games. I also helped provide information on video games
					and ther respective accessories. This job required immense patience and customer service because there were many items that were non-refundable that wesold. When people found out
					that they couldn't get their money back, it was a lot of work to get them calmed down. Eventually, around <strong class="gs-description">December of that year</strong>, I left
					because the holiday season ended and there weren't enough hours. It wasn't until <strong class="gs-description">June of 2015 </strong> I came back to work there for the summer
					until school started.
